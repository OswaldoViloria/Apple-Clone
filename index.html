            <p>1. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase an eligible Mac or iPad at a Qualifying Location.
            Only one Apple Gift Card per eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies
            last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the
            eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice
            regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this
            promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option) as payment type at checkout shall receive a
            discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in one
            ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI
            installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over the
            two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately,
            Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off
            the eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than
            ACMI range from 12.49% to 23.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of July 1, 2022. If you choose the pay‑in‑full or
            one‑time‑payment option for an ACMI‑eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that
            purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI
            transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement at
            https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more information. ACMI is not
            available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating
            corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase
            Programs, or on refurbished devices. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. Available
